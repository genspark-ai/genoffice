; Keeps the genoffice command line (resources\cli, holding genoffice.cmd and the
; extension-less genoffice for Git Bash) on the installing user's PATH for the
; lifetime of the install. The value is read and written unexpanded
; (REG_EXPAND_SZ) so entries such as %USERPROFILE%\bin survive, and Explorer
; is told about the change so terminals opened afterwards see it.
; electron-builder compiles the script twice (the second pass, with
; BUILD_UNINSTALLER, only produces the uninstaller); an unreferenced function
; in either pass is a warning makensis treats as an error, hence the guards.
